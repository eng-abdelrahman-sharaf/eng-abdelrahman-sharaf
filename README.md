# Hey, I'm Abdelrahman 👋

I'm a **software engineer from Alexandria, Egypt** who enjoys building things that live on the web and delves into computer vision problems.  
Right now, I’m splitting my time between **frontend development** (mostly React/Next.js) and **applied machine learning** (YOLO, PyTorch, OpenCV).

## What I’ve Been Up To

- **Frontend Developer @ Blokkah (PropTech Startup, Saudi Arabia)**  
  Helping build a real estate platform from scratch. Worked on everything from turning 50+ Figma designs into a live Next.js app, to SEO, multi-domain setup, dashboards, and even integrating an AI chatbot for property search.  

- **Computer Vision @ Torpedo (ROV Team Competes in Prestigious Robotics Competitions like MATE ROV)**  
  Training models and writing vision code for our underwater robots. Used YOLO where classical methods failed, built a GUI for pilots, and tested everything in Gazebo before hardware integration.  

- **Public Relations @ ACM Alexandria (Oldest ACM Student Chapter and Winner of ACM Excellence Awards)**  
  Handled PR, helped organize events, coordinated with sponsors, and worked on bringing industry experts to give students real-world insights.

## Projects I’m Proud Of

- **Canvas App** — A painting app with custom tools (pen, eraser, undo/redo, etc.)
- **CrocoHealth** — AI-powered health assistant (posture checker + medical bot + AI coach)
- **HOOP Detection Model** — Trained YOLOv11 to detect basketball hoops in poor lighting
- **AVL vs BST Visualizer** — Small Python app to teach and visualize data structures
- **Connect Hub** — A social media platform in Java/JavaFX with groups, posts, and stories
